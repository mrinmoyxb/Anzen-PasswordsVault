# 🔐 Anzen - PasswordsVault

Juggling secure passwords for all our online accounts is a constant battle. We need complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols to thwart hackers, but those very elements make them difficult to remember. We're stuck between creating passwords so secure they're like cryptic puzzles, or resorting to weak, easily guessed options. It's a frustrating tightrope walk between security and convenience. That's where Anzen comes in. 

An Android application built using **`Kotlin and Jetpack Compose`** that can store and generate passwords as well as check your passwords health.


## 🎯 Objectives

There are three main objectives of this project:

* First objective of this project is to **`store passwords`** using Room Database.

* Second objective of this project is to **`generate random passwords`** based on length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers or symbols selected by the user.

* And the final objective, to build a metric known as **`complexity score`**, that will calculate the strength of passwords provided by the user.
## 🛠️ Technologies

* **`Kotlin`**
* **`Jetpack Compose`**
* **`Room Database`**
